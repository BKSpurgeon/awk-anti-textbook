# Regex

Regex stands as a short form for Regular Expressions is often used in programming for pattern matching.

    code ⏰  awk '/[MDC]/ {print}' sales.csv
    March,100
    May,900
    December,545

Create a new file from sales.csv and add a $ to both month and the sales, i.e. the header.

    code ⏰  awk '/\$/ { print }' rsales.csv
    $month,$sales

The above program will print all the lines that has `$` in it, but because $ is used as a regex, we have to escape it with a backspace.

    code ⏰  awk '/...ember/ {print}' rsales.csv
    September,456
    November,934
    December,545

The `.` operator is used as 'matches any three characters

    code ⏰  awk '/Ju*/ {print}' rsales.csv
    Jan,100
    June,1000
    July,10

The * matches with 0 or more characters after Ju, which means, it'll

The reason why the above regex matches Jan is that it requires J at the start and 0 or more occurances of anything after 'u', _including_ 'u'.
