# Regex

Regex stands as a short form for Regular Expressions is often used in programming for pattern matching.

`[MDC]` matches any line with M or D or C in it.

    code ⏰  awk '/[MDC]/ {print}' sales.csv
    March,100
    May,900
    December,545

If you want to match sequential characters, you can use `[ABCDEFGHI]`, or the shortcut, like `[A-I]`.

    code ⏰  awk -F, '$1 ~ /[A-I]/{print}' sales.csv
    Feb,200
    April,50
    April,50
    April,50
    April,50
    August,20
    December,545
    December,545

We can further work on this pattern and print all the lines which start with any characters from A to I.

    code ⏰  awk -F, '$1 ~ /^[A-I]/{print}' sales.csv
    Feb,200
    April,50

    August,20
    December,545

    code ⏰  awk -F, '$1 ~ /^[a-i]/ {print}' sales.csv

If you run the above code, you'll notice that the code does'nt print anything. That is because RegEx are case sensitive. If you give [a-i], it'll match only a to i, if you give [A-I] it'll match A to I.

Give all lines whose first field does not start with A to I.

    code ⏰  awk -F, '$1~/^[^A-N]/{print}' sales.csv
    month,sales
    September,456
    October,134
    September,456
    September,456

Here, we have used the `^` twice, the first usage of cap (/^) means the regular starts with and the second use `[^A-N]` means negate what is present in the square bracket. Which means that it should match anything other than A to N.

All the lines that end with either l or r. 

    code ⏰  awk -F, '$1 ~ /[lr]$/ {print}' sales.csv
    April,50

Match 2 digit number for sales.

    code ⏰  awk -F, '$2 ~ /^[0-9]{2}$/ {print}' sales.csv
    April,50
    April,50
    April,50
    April,50
    August,20
    July,10
    July,10
    July,10
    July,10

`/^[0-9]{2}$/` means that you have to match the second field which starts with numbers and is 2 digits long. 

{2} means 2 digits long, {3} means 3 digits long and so on. The same logic can be applied on alphabets too.

`[a-zA-Z]` matches any lowercase or upper case character. So here, what we are looking for is any line whose first field starts with lower case a to z/upper case a-z and is 3 characters long.

    code ⏰  awk -F, '$1 ~ /^[a-zA-Z]{3}$/ {print}' sales.csv
    Jan,100
    Feb,200
    Jan,100
    Jan,100
    Jan,100
    May,900

This matches the above output because the output has both upper case and lower case characters.

    code ⏰  echo ABC | awk -F, '$1 ~ /^[A-Z]{3}$/ {print}'

Matches ABC as all three characters are upper case.

    code ⏰  echo abc | awk -F, '$1 ~ /^[a-z]{3}$/ {print}'

Matches abc as all three are lower case characters.
    
    code ⏰  echo Abc | awk -F, '$1 ~ /^[a-z]{3}$/ {print}'

Does not match Abc because it contains both upper case and lower case characters.

This matches two patterns, first, it looks for 3 letter months with both upper and lower case characters and it looks for months which start with any character between S to Z.

    code ⏰  awk -F, '$1 ~ /^[A-Ma-z]{3}$/ ||  $1 ~ /^[S-Z]/ {print}' sales.csv

Validating an IPv4 address 

    code ⏰  echo 127.0.0.10000 | awk  '$0 ~ /^[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}$/ {print}'

    code ⏰  echo 127.0.0.1 | awk  '$0 ~ /^[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}$/ {print}'

    code ⏰  echo 12:13:14:55 | awk '$0 ~ /[1-3]{2}:[1-3]{2}:[1-4]{2}:[1-5]{2}/ {print}'
    12:13:14:55
    code ⏰  echo 12:13:14:65 | awk '$0 ~ /[1-3]{2}:[1-3]{2}:[1-4]{2}:[1-5]{2}/ {print}'

We had to escape the dot, because dot carries special significance in regex. There is no special significance for a colon, that's why we did not have to escape it.

Validate a mobile number.

A mobile number is a 10 digit number which can't start with 0. The other nine digits can be anything between 0 to 9.

    code ⏰  echo 9999999999 | awk '/^[1-9][0-9]{9}$/{print}'

`^[1-9]` matches the first digit from the left of our number
`[0-9]{9}$` matches the last nine digits of our number.

Create a new file from sales.csv and add a $ to both month and the sales, i.e. the header.

    code ⏰  awk '/\$/ { print }' rsales.csv
    $month,$sales

The above program will print all the lines that has `$` in it, but because $ is used as a regex, we have to escape it with a backspace.

    code ⏰  awk '/...ember/ {print}' rsales.csv
    September,456
    November,934
    December,545

The `.` operator is used as 'matches any character'. If you use three dots then they match any three characters.

    code ⏰  awk '/Ju*/ {print}' rsales.csv
    Jan,100
    June,1000
    July,10

The * matches with 0 or more characters after Ju, which means, it'll Match J, Ju, June, July, Juuu etc

This is because u's occurances are 0 or more because we are using a '*'.
