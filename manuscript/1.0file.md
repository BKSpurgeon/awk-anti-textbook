We are going to play with the output of `ls -l` command in an attempt to figure out what all we can do with the wonderful language which is called awk.

Please run `ls -l` on your commandline and see what the output is. For me, it is showing it as

Note: Till now we saw how to use awk on files. In the above command, we are passing the output of a command (ls, in this case) to awk. This is called piping and it is a very fundamental unix feature.

The delimiter is space by default, so we did not have to override it. $5 is the fifth field in the output, which is the size.

We saw that a block of code is enclosed within `{}`. Now, in the above code, we have run `'$5>300 {print}'`. This tells awk to print the lines only if the fifth field is greater than 300.

* Print the names of files that has the character c in its name somewhere.

note: this is equivalent to the command `ls -l | grep c`

The `~` syntax is widely used when we want to _match_ the field with some particular value. Here, it is just checking if the character `c` is present in the line or not.

Note: We have used $NF, you can experiment with $1 till $8

* Run two commands at the same time

Note that this does not make it a logical and. It just executes both the scripts one after another.

What happens in the above code is that the condition $NF ~ /c/ ||  $5>300  is evaluated first and THEN the print statement gets executed.

Note: If you want to print only specific fields, please print specific fields

* File names starting with c

In regular expressions ^ is used to match the start of line and $ is used to match end of line. So when we say match with /^c/, we say print all lines that start with c.

When we give the below command, it prints all the *.md files. This is equivalent to `ls -l *.md`
