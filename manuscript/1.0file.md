# Files and Sales

We are going to play with the `sales.csv` file and the output of `ls -l` command in this chapter.

* Searching all the lines which contain J
        
The above command is equivalent of `grep "J" sales.csv`

        code ⏰  awk '/J/ {print}' sales.csv
        Jan,100
        June,1000
        July,10


Note: If you don't know what the `ls -l` command does then please research on bash shell before proceeding.

* Print the names of files that are larger than 300 bytes

        book ⏰  ls -l | awk '$5>300 {print}'

Explanation:
        
We conditionally print the line in the above command. The condition should *always* be *outside* the curly braces and inside the quotes.
        
However, if one really wants the condition inside the curly brackets then they can use the if statement which we will explore later.

* Print the names of files that has the character c in its name somewhere.

        awk book ⏰  ls -l | awk '$NF ~ /c/ {print}'

        -rw-r--r--  1 admin  staff  692088 Aug 23  2016 cover.xcf

Explanation:

If the last field of `ls -l` contains `c` then print the entire line.

* Print the names of file which don't have `c` in their name

        awk book ⏰  ls -l | awk '$NF !~ /c/ {print}'

The meaning of ~:

The `~` syntax is used to _match_ the field with a particular value. Here, we used it to match with `/c/` i.e. with the character `c`.

Explanation:

If the last field of `ls -l` does not contain `c` then print the entire line. The `!` mark denotes the negation.

Note: We have used $NF, but you can very well use $8.

* Run two commands at the same time (Logical OR)

        awk book ⏰  ls -l | awk '$NF ~ /c/ {print} $5>300 {print}'

Note that this does not make it a logical and. It just executes both the commands.

We can re-write the above command as:

        awk book ⏰  ls -l | awk '$NF ~ /c/ ||  $5>300 {print}'

Here, `||` stands for logical `OR`.

Explanation:

We have two conditions in the above command and one block of code. When either of the two condition is matched as a True, the line will be printed.

* Logical AND 

        awk book ⏰  ls -l | awk '$NF ~ /c/ &&  $5>300 {print}'

        -rw-r--r--  1 admin  staff  692088 Aug 23  2016 cover.xcf

Explanation:

Here, the line will be printed only if the file name i.e. the last field has c in it and the file's size is greater than 300.

* File names starting with a

        awk book ⏰  ls -l | awk '$NF ~ /^a/  {print}'
        -rw-r--r--@ 1 admin  staff      60 Jul 11 23:52 awkbook.code-workspace 

Explanation:

^ is used to match the start of line. /^c/: matches all the strings that start with `c`.

* File names ending with `md`
  
        awk book ⏰  ls -l | awk '$NF ~ /\.md$/  {print}'

Explanation:

`$` is used to match end of line. `/\.md$/` matches with all the lines where the file ends with `.md`. Here, we needed to escape the `.` because it carried special significance. That's why, we added a backslash before the `.`.

* Finding out the total size of all the files in your current directory
        
        ls -l | awk '{sum+=$5} END {print sum}'

* BEGIN: The block that is executed _once_ at the start of the code. All the variable assignment should ideally be done here

* `/J/ {}`: this block is not in BEGIN or END, thus, it is executed 

* END: The block that is executed _once_ at the end of the code. All the printing should go there.

awk will read the sales.csv with the delimiter of comma, it'll initialize a variable called sales. Then, for each line in sales.csv, awk will run `/J/ {sales+=$2}` i.e. increment the sales variable. At the end, we print it.

* Finding the sum of sales for all lines that has J in it.

        awk -F"," 'BEGIN{sales=0} /J/ {sales+=$2} END {print sales}' sales.csv


* Printing data into seperate files according to Financial Quarters

A financial year has four quarters, Q1 to Q4 of three months each. What we want to do is split our file into four such files depending on the year.

        code ⏰  awk -F"," '/Jan/||/Feb/||/Mar/ {print}' sales.csv > Q1.csv
        code ⏰  cat Q1.csv
        Jan,100
        Feb,200
        March,100

Exercise: Write the code for other three quarters. This is a bit cumbersome code, in the next chapters when we go to a bit advanced awk, we'll learn how to do all this in one line of awk code.

* Split the data according to sales

If the sales of a particular month is less than 500, write it to 500.csv, if greater than 500 and less than 1000 then in 1000.csv, any value above it should go in large.csv

        code ⏰  awk -F"," '$2 <=500 {print}' sales.csv > 500.csv
        code ⏰  cat 500.csv
        Jan,100
        Feb,200
        March,100
        April,50
        July,10
        August,20
        September,456
        October,134

        code ⏰  awk -F"," '$2 > 500 && $2 < 1000 {print}' sales.csv > 1000.csv
        code ⏰  cat 1000.csv
        May,900
        November,934
        December,545

        code ⏰  awk -F"," '$2 > 1000 {print}' sales.csv > large.csv
        code ⏰  cat large.csv
        month,sales

The issue here is that we don't have any sales that is above 1000, but still, we have an entry in the large file. What happened here is the string got converted into number and then the comparison happened. We want to avoid that. For that, we need to filter out the header of the file while doing the processing.

Typically, you can use sed to delete the header.

        code ⏰  sed '1d' sales.csv

But because we are learning awk, we'll use awk to delete the header, or rather, ignore the header while processing the text.

        code ⏰  awk 'NR>1 {print}' sales.csv

NR: an internal awk variable which stores the line number of the file being processed.

        code ⏰  awk '{print NR, $0}' sales.csv
        1 month,sales
        2 Jan,100
        3 Feb,200
        4 March,100
        5 April,50
        6 May,900
        7 June,1000
        8 July,10
        9 August,20
        10 September,456
        11 October,134
        12 November,934
        13 December,545

* print all lines longer than 10 characters
        
        code ⏰  awk 'length > 10 {print}' sales.csv
        month,sales
        September,456
        October,134
        November,934
        December,545

Note: length($0) is equivalent to length.

Because we want to skip the header, we use the following command.

        code ⏰  awk 'NR>1 && length($0) > 10 {print}' sales.csv
        September,456
        October,134
        November,934
        December,545


* Finding max length of a file

        code ⏰  awk '{if (length($0)>max) max = length($0)} END {print "max length is ", max}' sales.csv
        max length is  13

The if condition is executed inside the first block

        {if (condition) statement}

Then, the END block gets executed at the end of the execution and we print the max length

* Ignore empty line

Add an empty line in sales.csv

        code ⏰  awk -F"," 'NF>1 {print}' sales.csv
        month,sales
        Jan,100
        Feb,200
        March,100
        April,50
        May,900
        June,1000
        July,10
        August,20
        September,456
        October,134
        November,934
        December,545

To see how this works, we must understand how NF works, which is obvious from the below script execution

        code ⏰  awk -F"," '{print NF, $0}' sales.csv
        2 month,sales
        2 Jan,100
        0
        2 Feb,200
        0
        2 March,100
        2 April,50
        2 May,900
        2 June,1000
        2 July,10
        2 August,20
        2 September,456
        2 October,134
        2 November,934
        2 December,545

* Print number of lines of a file

        code ⏰  awk 'END {print NR}' sales.csv
        15
        code ⏰  wc -l sales.csv
        15 sales.csv

Why this works?

We already have seen what NR stands for. Consider this, what will be the value of NR at the end of the file parsing? Yes, it'll be the line number of the last line.


* Print even odd lines

        code ⏰  awk 'NR % 2 == 0 {print}' sales.csv
        Jan,100
        Feb,200
        March,100
        May,900
        July,10
        September,456
        November,934

Change 0 to 1 in the above example and you'll find that the odd numbered lines are being printed

* Print the number of files that were updated in a particular month

You first need to find out in which all months have your files being updated on.

        awk book ⏰  ls -l | awk '{print $6}' | sort | uniq
        Dec
        Jul

Run the above command in your terminal. In my terminal, I have files updated only in Dec and Jul, so I'll use one of those in the below command


        awk book ⏰  ls -l | awk '{if ($6 == "Jul") x = x + 1} END {print x}'
        6
        awk book ⏰  ls -l | grep Jul | wc -l
        6

The first command can be rewritten as
        
        awk book ⏰  ls -l | awk '$6 == "Jul" { x = x + 1} END {print x}'

Note: Do check the output of `ls -l` on your terminal. $6 for me is the month in which the file was last updated, it could very well not be the same in your case.
