# File manipulation

We want to prepare our sales.csv file based on rsales.csv

    code ⏰  awk -F"," -OFS="," 'NR==1 { $1="month"; $2="sales"; print } NR>1 && NF>1 {print}' rsales.csv > sales.csv
    code ⏰  cat sales.csv
    month,sales

What we did in the above code:

1. Updated the first and second fields of the header using the first block. If you just assign variables to $1 and $2, their values are changed.
2. In the scond block, we parse _only_ those the non header lines (NR>1) and the not null lines (NF>1)

But there is an obvious problem, the header is not comma seperated. All we have to do is set the output field seperator, OFS.

    code ⏰  awk -v OFS="," -F"," 'NR==1 { $1="month"; $2="sales"; print } NR>1 && NF>1 {print}' rsales.csv > sales.csv

Let's now create a new file by the name s_sales.csv. 

Modify the sales.csv to contain multiple lines for each month and then change the second column so that it should be unique for every month.

Place the lines randomly and not one after the other. A line containing Jan should be followed by some month other than Jan. This is to show that you don't need a sorted file

    code ⏰ sed '1d' sales.csv | sort  -o s_sales.csv

Note: Removes the header and sorts the file


    code ⏰  awk -F"," '{file= $1 ".tcsv"; printf "%s,", $2 > file}' s_sales.csv
    code ⏰  for file in `ls *.tcsv`; do     
                name=`echo $file | awk -F"." '{print $1}'`;     
                `awk -v OFS="," -F"," -v name="$name" '{output="op.txt"; for(i=1;i<NF;i++){x+= $1} print name,x >>output}' $file`;  
            done && rm *.tcsv

    code ⏰  cat op.txt
